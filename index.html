    <h2> The menu </h2>

    <p> The famous dinner set menu of Gaggan is its innovative <strong> Emojiüòä menu </strong>. </p>

    </ul>

    <h2> Highlighted Dining Memories </h2>

    <p>
       Among the 25 signature dishes, this section will introduce a few that are the most impressive.
    </p>

    <h3>"Lick It Up"</h3>

    <p>
        Though the 25 courses on menu change every a few months, Lick It Up is one of the settled dishes well-known for its innovation in edible methods and combination with the classic song <em>Lick It Up</em> released in 1983.  
    </p>

    <h3>Chili Egg Nest</h3>
<p>
        The egg nest looking dish is represented not by the emoji eggü•ö, but chiliüå∂Ô∏è. The reason for that is because it is the chili sauce stuffing the white chocolate egg that matters. It is also a settled dish.
    </p>

   <h3> Lamb Chop with Lemon Chili </h3>

    <p>
        No one can relate the lemonüçã emoji to lamb chop in the first place. However, Gaggan did. The lemon flavored chili does not conceal the strong smell of lamb, but neutralize it to be a more fresh and pleasant smell.

    <h2> The whole dining journey </h2>
    <p> Here is a video upload by YouTube user <em>Foodie Stories by Anders Husa<em> in 2018.

    <h3>Responsive interactive chart</h3>

    <p>With the wide spread tools today, you don't have to learn frontend technology in order to make interactive charts. For example, there are off-the-shelf online tools like
        <a href="https://infogram.com/">infogram.com</a>,
        <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/">datawrapper</a>, and
        <a href="https://flourish.studio/">flourish</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are Python developer, libraries like <code>plotly</code>, <code>pyecharts</code>, <code>bokeh</code>, and <code>folium</code> can help you generate interactive charts and maps within Python environment. Next question is how to embed those
        interactive charts into your final work.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first thing is to use your chosen library/ online tool to export a standalone webpage that includes your chart. The webpage may come along with other auxiliary files like Javascript and CSS. You need to put those files all in one folder. Then use
        your browser to visit the webpage and make sure the chart looks normal as a standalone project. After that, ou can apply the same technique used from above responsive Youtube video to embed it into your web story Just use the following code block
        and replace the "src" attribute with the right path to your stand alone interactive chart.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>&#x3C;responsive-block&#x3E;&#x3C;iframe src=&#x27;//server-name/path/to/the/file.html&#x27; frameborder=&#x27;0&#x27; allowfullscreen&#x3E;&#x3C;/iframe&#x3E;&#x3C;/responsive-block&#x3E;</code>
    </p>

    <p> Here is an example of a map made from Python's <code>folium</code> library. It is the original hi-fi version of the raster image used in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aFfa7WlyT0vwXBlDYvacCg">this blog post</a>. Although the following one is
        not interactive or animated, you can easily make it so from the <code>folium</code> library. </p>

    <responsive-block>
        <iframe src='charts/openrice-sichuan-food/map.html' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
    </responsive-block>

    <p>
        Following is an animated and interactive map of Sichuan's earthquake in past 100 years. It is made by D3. The project includes many auxiliary files to make the chart work. We'd like to show you that the responsive block works with not only charts on your
        local disk, but also charts (more precisely HTML pages) from the Internet. Note, in the "src" attribute, <strong>please start your URL with "//"</strong>, not "http", or "https". This notation lets the browser determine which protocol
        to use and improves compatibility.
    </p>

    <responsive-block>
        <iframe src='//hupili.net/20170800-sichuan-earthquake-in-100years/' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
    </responsive-block>

    <p>
        Note that the default aspect ratio is 16:9. Sometimes, 1:1 may look better on a vertical screen. Or, you can try 4:3, whose code is available in HTML comment block. Other aspect ratios are not suggested since this is a starter's template.
    </p>

    <ratio-1-to-1>
        <responsive-block>
            <iframe src='//hupili.net/20170800-sichuan-earthquake-in-100years/' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
        </responsive-block>
    </ratio-1-to-1>

    <!-- 
    <ratio-4-to-3>
        <responsive-block>
            <iframe src='//hupili.net/20170800-sichuan-earthquake-in-100years/' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>
        </responsive-block>
    </ratio-4-to-3>

    <h2>This page on desktop?</h2>

    <p>It does not use up the entire space on a desktop computer. However it is still readable. Now that 80% traffic is on mobile web, this should suffice for most web stories. Also note that, you just learned HTML 10 minutes ago and this is what you can
        make.
